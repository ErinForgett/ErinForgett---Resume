        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Political ScienceðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Iâ€™m about to enter my third year as a political science major at the University of California, Riverside. Iâ€™m on the pre law pathway so I look forward to exploring all my options in the law field. Currently Iâ€™m the co-president of a club called Mock Trial. In Mock Trial, we take on roles involved with trials, like attorneys and witnesses. We then create materials like direct examinations and cross examinations based on a case packet that we get from the organization that oversees us. The case changes every year between being criminal and civil. For the upcoming school year, we will have a criminal case. Aside from being co-president of the club, I also have competitive roles on our team. In the past I have acted as a witness and as an attorney. This year, I have only attorney roles and will also be giving an 8 minute long statement.<br><br>

        Outside of the mock trial team, I work on campus in the Student Life office. More specifically, I work for Highlander Orientation which is housed under First Year Student Programs. This is my second year working with Orientation and I have a different role than I did last year. The first year I worked for Orientation, my role was an Orientation Leader. Orientation Leaders lead groups of students through orientation sessions during the summer. They undergo over 100 hours of training in order to know everything there is to know about the University Of California, Riverside and pass along that knowledge to the incoming students. Much of the training is about maintaining confidentiality, fostering an inclusive environment, and becoming a successful leader. This role took my entire summer and required me to live on campus. Since the Orientation Leader role is most busy during the summer months, once I finished last summer, I decided to apply for a higher position in Orientation. I now work as something called a Program Assistant. Program Assistants plan Orientation and begin working much earlier than the Orientation Leaders do. In this role, I coordinate with campus partners, professional staff, and off campus companies in order to plan Orientation. Not only do I help to plan Orientation but I also interview, pick, train, and then supervise a team of 54 Orientation Leaders. Throughout the summer I act as the point person for these Orientation Leaders during sessions and help to keep things running smoothly. Some of those responsibilities include leading presentations, managing crisis situations, and supporting Orientation Leaders through any challenges they face. This position is very fulfilling and has helped me develop my leadership skills greatly.<br><br>

        Not only do I work for New Student Programs through Orientation but Iâ€™m also a First Year Peer Mentor through Student Life. This position requires me to meet once a week with a first year student who has been assigned to me. During our meetings I answer any questions my mentee might have and help support them in their transition to college by providing them with any necessary resources. Overally, I greatly love being involved with various programs at the University of California, Riverside.
